									<h2>ABOUT US</h2>
								</header>
								<p> Based in Singapore, EIGHTBA is an Asia-centric Football Consultancy firm. We aim to transform football in Asia through our thought leadership, in-depth and hands-on experience, as well as exclusive access to a global network of reputable football partners.</p>
								<hr />
								<p><strong> Why Asia?</strong> To us, Asia is an unpolished gem in the world of football with untapped opportunities abound. Compared to European football, Asia is at a relatively nascent stage of growth. EIGHTBA is excited to be part of this growth trajectory as we witness continued infrastructure investments by governments and associations, improved country-level leagues and regional-level competitions, growing interest of Asian fans and better talent development.</p>
								<hr />
								<p><strong> What set us apart from the rest?</strong> First, EIGHTBA has an in-depth understanding of the football ecosystem, such as the importance of football in the national agenda, the role of football as an enabler of sustainable development goals, the symbiotic relationship between football and media, the economics of football, and the life cycle of a professional footballer. Second, EIGHTBA knows the key success factors of European football, and having been in Asia for close to a decade, EIGHTBA is well-poised to adapt them to the Asian context. Third, EIGHTBA is forward-thinking. Although football is a sport with long tradition, EIGHTBA constantly thinks of incorporating the latest trends and technologies in the projects we embark on. The current pandemic has also prompted us to ponder over the changing dynamics of football given an increasingly socially distanced world with evolving audience profiles.</p>
								<hr />
								<p><strong> What do we offer?</strong> To unleash the potential of football in Asia, we work closely with key stakeholders to develop best-in-class solutions throughout the entire football business value chain. Our areas of expertise include, but are not limited to, investments in clubs in major leagues, talent development and management, media engagement and marketing, as well as sports technology. With EIGHTBA, you are assured of pragmatic bespoke advice, tailored according to your specific needs.</p>
